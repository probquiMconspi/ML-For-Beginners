Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is a popular and stable Linux distribution that offers enterprise-level features and support. If you want to install RHEL on your i386 system, you will need to download the DVD ISO image from the Red Hat Customer Portal and burn it to a DVD disc. In this article, we will show you how to do that step by step.

## Step 1: Download the DVD ISO image
 
To download the DVD ISO image of RHEL 5.3 for i386, you will need to have an active subscription to Red Hat products and services. If you don't have one, you can register for a free trial at [https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/download](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/download). Once you have logged in to the Red Hat Customer Portal, go to [https://access.redhat.com/downloads/](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/) and select Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server from the product list. Then, choose the version 5.3 from the drop-down menu and click on the Binary DVD link under the Downloads section. The file name should be something like rhel-server-5.3-i386-dvd.iso and the file size should be about 3.6 GB.
 
## Step 2: Verify the md5sum of the downloaded file
 
Before burning the ISO image to a DVD disc, it is recommended that you verify its integrity by checking its md5sum. The md5sum is a unique string of characters that identifies a file and can be used to detect any corruption or modification during the download process. To check the md5sum of the downloaded file, you can use the md5sum command in a terminal window. For example, if you have saved the file in your Downloads folder, you can run the following command:
 `md5sum ~/Downloads/rhel-server-5.3-i386-dvd.iso` 
The output should match the md5sum value provided on the download page. If it does not match, you will need to download the file again.
 
## Step 3: Burn the ISO image to a DVD disc
 
Once you have verified the md5sum of the downloaded file, you can burn it to a DVD disc using any burning software that supports ISO images. For example, if you are using Windows, you can use Windows Disc Image Burner or any third-party software like ImgBurn or Nero. If you are using Linux, you can use Brasero or K3b or any other software that can burn ISO images. Make sure you choose the option to burn the image as a single session and verify the disc after burning.
 
## Step 4: Install RHEL from the DVD disc
 
After burning the ISO image to a DVD disc, you can use it to install RHEL on your i386 system. To do that, you will need to boot your system from the DVD drive and follow the installation wizard.
