The Rules of the Court of Appeal 1994 Malaysia are intended to facilitate the expeditious and efficient disposal of civil appeals in the Court of Appeal. They reflect the principle that an appeal is not a rehearing or a retrial of the case, but a review of the decision of the lower court based on the record of proceedings and the grounds of judgment. The Court of Appeal has the power to affirm, reverse or vary the decision appealed against, or to order a new trial or further hearing, or to make any other order as it thinks fit.
 
The Rules also aim to promote consistency and uniformity in the practice and procedure of civil appeals in the Court of Appeal. They apply to all civil appeals from the High Court or any other court or tribunal as provided by law, unless otherwise expressly provided by any written law. They also apply to any matter incidental to or arising out of any appeal, such as applications for leave to appeal, stay of proceedings, extension of time, amendment of notice or memorandum of appeal, admission of further evidence, review of order, etc.
 
The Rules are supplemented by various practice directions and circulars issued by the Chief Justice from time to time. These provide further guidance and clarification on specific aspects or issues relating to civil appeals in the Court of Appeal. For example, Practice Direction No. 1/2010 sets out the procedure for filing electronic records of appeal and electronic bundles of authorities; Practice Direction No. 2/2010 prescribes the format and content of written submissions; and Circular No. 1/2018 stipulates the requirements for filing hard copies of records of appeal and bundles of authorities.
