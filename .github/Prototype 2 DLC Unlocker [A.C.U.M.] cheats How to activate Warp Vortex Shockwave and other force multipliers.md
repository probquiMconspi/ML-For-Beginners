Prototype 2 is a 2012 action-adventure game developed by Radical Entertainment and published by Activision. The game follows James Heller, a soldier who gains shapeshifting abilities after being infected by a virus. Heller can use his powers to fight against the Blacklight virus and its creator, Alex Mercer, the protagonist of the first Prototype game.
 
Prototype 2 features various downloadable content (DLC) packs that add new skins, abilities, weapons, and missions to the game. However, some players may want to unlock all the DLCs without paying for them or completing the required challenges. This is where a DLC unlocker comes in handy.

A DLC unlocker is a tool that modifies the game files to enable all the DLCs for free. One of the most popular DLC unlockers for Prototype 2 is [A.C.U.M.] (All Content Unlocker Mod), which was created by a user named Skidrow. This mod not only unlocks all the DLCs, but also enables some cheats that can make the game easier or more fun.
