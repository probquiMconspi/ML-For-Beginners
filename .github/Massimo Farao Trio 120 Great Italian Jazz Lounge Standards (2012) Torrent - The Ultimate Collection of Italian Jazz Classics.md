The album is available for streaming and download on various platforms, such as Spotify and Qobuz. It is a perfect choice for anyone who loves jazz and Italian music, or who wants to enjoy a relaxing and romantic atmosphere with some of the most beautiful songs ever written.[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]

The album consists of four CDs, each containing 30 tracks. The songs are arranged in alphabetical order, from *A come amore* to *Zum zum zum*. The trio plays with a smooth and sophisticated touch, creating a warm and intimate sound that blends well with the melodies. The piano is the main instrument, but the bass and drums also contribute to the rhythm and harmony. The trio demonstrates their versatility and creativity by interpreting the songs in different ways, sometimes adding a swing or a bossa nova feel, sometimes playing with the tempo or the dynamics, sometimes adding some improvisation or variation.
 
The album is a great example of how jazz can adapt and transform any kind of music, while still respecting its original essence and spirit. The trio manages to capture the emotions and the stories behind the songs, as well as the beauty and the diversity of the Italian culture. The album is a musical journey that takes the listener from the sunny coasts of Sicily to the romantic canals of Venice, from the historic monuments of Rome to the artistic treasures of Florence, from the cheerful festivals of Naples to the glamorous fashion of Milan. The album is a celebration of Italy and its music, as well as a tribute to some of its most famous singers and composers, such as Adriano Celentano, Lucio Dalla, Andrea Bocelli, Domenico Modugno, and many others.

The album is also a great way to discover some lesser-known gems of the Italian repertoire, such as *Amore baciami*, *Che cosa c'Ã¨*, *Il cielo in una stanza*, and *Non dimenticar*. These songs are not as famous as the ones mentioned before, but they are equally charming and captivating. They showcase the diversity and the richness of the Italian musical genres, such as pop, rock, folk, opera, and canzone. They also reflect the different moods and themes of the Italian songs, such as love, nostalgia, joy, sadness, and humor.
